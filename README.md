## Specification for application

### What are the functions of the program?

#### Core Functionality

- Record a daily / current workout with weight amounts.
  - **Workout** - **Sets** - **Reps**
- Create workout sets using pre-defined exercises from workout catagories.
  - **Workout Section** - **Workout** - **Sets** - **Reps**
- Export created workouts to:
  - Excel Sheet / CSV
  - Website <- *stretch goal*

#### Extra Functionality

- Generate a predictive model for weight lifting using a linear regression model
  - How much weight can I lift in X amount of days?
- Search recorded workouts which displays to screen within Gradio.
- Search created workout sets which displays to screen within Gradio and provides export capabilities.

### What are the components (libraries) that need to exist?

- Gradio
  - Allows UI to function
- Pandas
  - Necessary for working with dataframes and CSV files
- SQLite
  - Allows creation of searchable database for workouts / workout sets.

## Specification from DATA 333 Canvas

You will design and build a simple but meaningful interactive Python app that demonstrates your understanding of user-centered design, basic programming, and GUI development using Gradio (or other GUI frameworks we've covered).

This final project is your opportunity to show creativity, problem-solving, and technical implementation—all in one!
Requirements

1. Functional GUI

2. 4-5 functions using modeling, databases, loops and data structures. 

3. Stable performance.

Short Presentation (6–8 minutes)

Record a short video (screen + voice) or give a live presentation covering:

- Your app idea and the problem it solves

- Target users and scenarios

- A live walkthrough/demo of your app

- Explanation of how your logic works

- Any challenges you faced and how you solved them

- Every group member should participate in this presentation
